This program will take an input file where each line is an individual math equation. It will then select one of those math equations for the user to guess while providing feedback if the output is incorrect. If the guess is not valid because the equation is invalid or of an invalid length, the guess will not count. If the right character is in the right place, it will be surrounded with * characters; if it is a character in the equation, but not in the right place, it will be surrounded with . characters; and if the the character is not in the equation at all, it will not be surrounded by anything.
